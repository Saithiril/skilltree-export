## Notable Changes

### 3.17.0
---
The amount of nodes per orbit has changed to give us more angles to work with.

| Orbit | Nodes (Old) | Nodes (New) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 6 | 6 |
| 2 | 12 | **16** |
| 3 | 12 | **16** |
| 4 | 40 | 40 |
| 5 | 72 | 72 |
| 6 | 72 | 72 |

The angle for positions in these orbits (2 & 3) are now:

| Orbit Index | Angle |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 30 |
| 2 | **45** |
| 3 | 60 |
| 4 | 90 |
| 5 | 120 |
